A robot simulator framework using a modified version of the Phys2d physics engine.

It's up to the developer using the framework to define the characteristics of the robot like shape, actuators and sensors.

Rendering and physics details are taken care of by the framework.

Currently a simple simulator for sumo robots have been implemented.
